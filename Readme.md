Big 'O' Notation

It is used to measure running time/space requirements for your program grow as your input size grows.

t = a*n + b


O(n) = as input size grows time also grows .. you can see the example of linear search.

O(1) = constant time

O(n2)

O(log n) = it will take less steps to solve the problem .. you can see the example of binary search.

Note : Always remember to keep fastest growing term (a*n + b) formula & drop constants
